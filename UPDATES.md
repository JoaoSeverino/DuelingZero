In mid-2023 the interest has been picking up, as more people learn about the printer.  Community development includes [Desune's Dueling Boops variant](https://github.com/desune2487/Dueling_Boops), Chadonka's gantry board mounts, and more stuff that should be released shortly.

Zruncho's back on it, too.  Tri-Zero spinoffs, like [ZeroPanels v3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5wUP4zZDg), have been tested first on Dueling Zero.  Watch this space carefully for major updates to documentation and design...

Also: Klipper code is more easily found [here](https://github.com/zruncho3d/klipper/tree/dual_gantry_main) now, as well as on the SOFTWARE page here.

### 2022-08-20: Alpha-1  
This first release covers everything you need to build and run your own Dueling Zero: CAD, STLs, DXFs, sample firmware configs, smart avoidance code, G-code streaming code, instructions, and a parts list... everything but an illustrated manual.  But if you're reading this, you almost certainly don't need a manual, anyway.

To make it easy for anyone to grok this crazy Dual Gantry layout - and learn about its opportunities and challenges, both in hardware and software - the repo walks through the software and the design.
