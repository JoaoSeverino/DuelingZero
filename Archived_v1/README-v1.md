The v1 gantry refers to original release from August 2022, with asymmetric underslung gantries: a low side, plus a high side with a strut.

There's nothing _wrong_ with this gantry, and Zruncho got 300 hrs out of his before upgrading, but it has some drawbacks relative to the v3:
* more unique parts
* less travel available in XY
* no nozzle-based bed probing
* top-mount rails constrain toolhead availability, somewhat
* different weights for each moving gantry means different input shaper values

All the v1 content is left here, to make things easier to find for those with builds in progress, or for those curious about the (more complex) design process with this one.

**See the [Design](DESIGN.md) page** - this has a visual walkthrough of every interesting part.
